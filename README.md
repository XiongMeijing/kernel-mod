[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wittawatj/kmod.svg?token=yWUaYGwontVUwf9G8fLY&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wittawatj/kmod)

A kernel test for model comparison

* Developed on Python 3.6.3. Some effort will be made to support Python 2.7. 

* Depends on the `kgof` package. This can be obtained from [its git
  repository](https://github.com/wittawatj/kernel-gof). Will need the Python 3
  version of the package.

* Since `kgof` package depends on `freqopttest`, you __may__ need to install it as
  well. This can be obtained from [its git
  repository](https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test). You will need
  the Python 3 version of the package.
